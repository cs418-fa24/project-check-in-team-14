    "We are analyzing Chicago home price data from Zillow to assist home buyers/investors in making informed decisions by understanding property value trends across different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Questions we are inestigating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How have home values changed in different Chicago neighborhoods over the past few years?\n",
    "2. Which neighborhoods have seen the biggest increases in home prices? Which neighborhoods have seen the biggest decreases in home prices?\n",
    "3. Which areas might be good investment opportunities based on price trends?\n",

    "## Changes from Initial Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our initial project proposal slides, we have simplified our scope to create a more focused and achievable analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removed from Scope:**\n",
    "- Complex geographical heat maps.\n",
    "- Analysis of property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage).\n",
    "- Both Zillow and Redfin data (focusing only on Zillow for consistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Added to Scope:**\n",
    "- Focused analysis on straightforward price trends using Zillow data\n",
    "- Simple, clear visualizations that are easy to interpret\n",
    "- Time series analysis showing price changes over years\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "1. **Data Consistency**\n",
    "  - Using Zillows data only makes sure we are using a more consistent and reliable dataset\n",
    "  - Takes away the complexity of merging different data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project Feasibility**\n",
    "  - Simplified visualizations ensure we can deliver high-quality analysis within the timeline\n",
    "  - Focusing on key price trends allows for clearer, more meaningful insights\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Core Value Delivery**\n",
    "  - Despite the simplified scope, our analysis still achieves the main goal of helping people understand neighborhood price trends\n",
    "  - Clear, straightforward, easy to interpret presentations are often more valuable than complex featuresble than complex featureses were made]"
